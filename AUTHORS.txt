 List of Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hakki Dogusan <dogusanh _at_ tr _dot_ net> contributed the Code Blocks
project file. (No longer distributed with Diluculum, since the build
system changed to CMake.)

Jason Gauci <jgmath2000 _at_ gmail _dot_ com> contributed the
implemention of 'LuaValue::asObjectPtr()' and the original
implementation of the Boost-less version of 'LuaValue'.

Yuriy Shmal <yuriy _at_ ellat _dot_ lv> reported that trying to access
"_G" from a Lua state resulted in a crash. This lead to the addition
of LuaState::globals().

Christof Warlich <christof _dot_ warlich _at_ thermofisher _dot_ com>
noticed that strings with embedded zeros comming from Lua were not
properly handled by Diluculum, and provided the solution for this bug.

Eugenio Bargiacchi <svalorzen _at_ gmail _dot_ com> fixed a memory
corruption bug that could manifest itself under quite rare
conditions. He also made the port to Lua 5.2.

Marcello Barnaba <m _dot_ barnaba _at_ ifad _dot_ org> and Andr√© Simon
<andre _dot_ simon1 _at_ gmx _dot_ de> made an initial effort to port
Diluculum to Lua 5.2; I think they deserve credit, too, so here are
their names.
