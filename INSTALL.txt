 DILUCULUM COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=====================================================


 Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Apart from Lua, Diluculum depends only on Boost
(http://www.boost.org). I think so, at least.


 Building
~~~~~~~~~~
Diluculum's official build system is based on SCons
(http://www.scons.org), so, ideally, you should have it (see "I Don't
Have SCons" below if you want alternatives). So, Once you have the
dependencies and SCons installed, just type 'scons' to build
Diluculum. You may wish to use the 'mode' option to set the build
mode. For instance, using 'scons mode=opt' you'll make an optimized
build. Use 'scons -h' for help.


 Installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use 'scons install'. You'll most likely like to use the 'prefix'
option to configure the installation root directory. In this case, the
installation command would be something like
'scons mode=opt prefix=/Foo/Bar/Diluculum install'.


 I Don't Have SCons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well, you should :-)

Anyway, I'll try to be nice and will provide alternatives as long as I
feel they worth the trouble to be created and maintained. Or, as
people contribute with project files for their favorite IDE or build
system.

So, check the 'Build' directory for some alternatives.
